General guidelines
==================

If your document type is published on the portal, you should be
careful when you are editing it, especially if you're messing with
indexed fields.

When you delete a type is not really deleted, check in the ZMI for
renamed types, if you need to get it back.

Original widgets type should be parsed and shown in TypeMaker.

You can tell if a widget type has required properties by adding in
its properties a new integer key named "is_required" (value: 1).

If you have a problem with some widgets, please submit them.
