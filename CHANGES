- Taking advantage of the new centralized CPSI18n.tests.translations module.
- Fixed translation files through the CPSI18n/bin/fix_pos script.
- Put back previous "multi-valued" value of a i18n:attributes attribute in ZPT
  now that #611 (Not possible to translate multiple attributes on same HTML
  element) is fixed.
- Modified some ZPT files so that they are valid XHTML 1.0 Strict. This is a
  work in progress to fix #773 "Using XHTML 1.0 Strict by default for CPS
